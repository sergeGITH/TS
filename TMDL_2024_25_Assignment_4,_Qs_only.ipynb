        "\n",
        "In the lecture, we saw some code that implemented MLPs and CNNs for the task of image classification on CIFAR10. However, we skipped over some details of what CNNs actually do.\n",
        "\n",
        "A CNN works by automatically learning and extracting meaningful patterns, features, and hierarchies from the input data in the following way:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Convolution**: A CNN applies (multiple) small filters (kernels) to an input image, performing element-wise multiplications and sums to extract features like edges, corners, and textures. We also did this computation in person during class. These kernels may be a matrix (what we saw in the lecture), or even a stack of matrices (e.g. for RGB images). I'd recommend watching this [3Blue1Brown video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuXjwB4LzSA&pp=ygUTY29udm9sdXRpb25zIGluIGNubg%3D%3D) and this [DeepLearning.AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTB_OFoAQcc) video for reference.\n",
        "2. **Non-linearity**: Non-linear activation functions (e.g., ReLU) are applied to introduce complexity and allows the capture of more abstract representations.\n",
        "3. **Pooling**: Pooling operations are used to downsample the spatial dimensions of feature maps while preserving the most important information. In both cases, a pooling window or filter moves across the input feature map, and a single value is selected or computed within the window based on the pooling operation. Pooling helps reduce the computational complexity of the network and introduces some translation invariance. There are a few types of pooling, but most commonly used are max-pooling and average-pooling.\n",
        "4. **Hierarchy**: Convolution and pooling operations are repeated to create a hierarchy of feature extraction layers, learning more complex and high-level features.\n",
        "5. **Fully Connected Layers**: Flattened features are passed through fully connected layers, similar to a traditional MLP, for classification or regression.\n",
        "6. **Training**: Parameters are adjusted using backpropagation and optimization algorithms to minimize the difference between predictions and true labels.\n",
        "\n",
        "By leveraging convolution, non-linearity, and hierarchical feature extraction, CNNs can automatically learn and recognize intricate patterns and structures in visual data, making them well-suited for tasks like image classification and object detection.\n",
        "\n",
        "You can think of the convolution operation with a kernel over an image as outputting a new modified image, called a feature map. When applying convolutions over feature maps, the size of the output feature map (in each dimension) can be computed by:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$o = \\frac{i - k + 2 p}{s + 1}$$\n",
        "\n",
        "where the hyperparameters of the convolution are:\n",
        "- $i$: input_size is the size (height or width) of the input feature map.\n",
        "- $k$: kernel_size is the size (height or width) of the convolutional kernel/filter.\n",
        "- $p$: padding is the number of pixels added to each side of the input feature map (if applicable) (default 0)\n",
        "- $s$: stride is the step size or the number of pixels the kernel moves at each step (default 1)\n",
        "\n",
        "The output size of a pooling operation can also be defined as:\n",
        "$$o = \\frac{i - p}{s+1 }$$\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q1.1** Thus, starting with a 28x28 pixel image (e.g. MNIST), write a series of kernel sizes to use in convolutions (optionally including a pooling operation if you want to try it out, and optionally padding and stride) in order to get it down to an image size of 6x6. There are several correct answers possible here."

        "# RNNs\n",
        "\n",
        "An RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) is a type of artificial neural network that is particularly effective in processing sequential data. Unlike feedforward neural networks, which process inputs independently, RNNs have connections that allow information to flow in cycles. This cyclic connectivity enables them to capture temporal dependencies and learn patterns over time. You can find more in these [neural network lecture notes (Jaeger 2023, chapter 4)](https://www.ai.rug.nl/minds/uploads/LN_NN_RUG.pdf). Here is an overview of how RNNs work:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Recurrent Connections**: RNNs have recurrent connections that allow information to be passed from one step to the next in a sequence. At each time step, the RNN takes an input and combines it with the information from the previous step. This feedback loop enables the network to have memory and make predictions based on the context of past inputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Hidden State**: RNNs maintain a hidden state vector that serves as a memory of the network. The hidden state is updated at each time step and contains information about the previous inputs in the sequence. It captures the network's understanding of the sequence up to that point and is used to influence the processing of future inputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Sequence Processing**: RNNs process sequences by iterating through each element one at a time. As the network receives an input at each time step, it updates its hidden state based on the input and the previous hidden state. The updated hidden state is then used to make predictions or generate outputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU)**: LSTMs and GRUs are popular types of RNN architectures that address the vanishing gradient problem and capture long-term dependencies more effectively. These architectures introduce specialized memory cells and gating mechanisms that allow the network to selectively update and forget information.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Training**: RNNs are typically trained using the backpropagation through time (BPTT) algorithm, which extends backpropagation to handle sequences. The goal is to minimize the difference between the predicted outputs and the true targets by adjusting the network's parameters through gradient descent optimization.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Applications**: RNNs are well-suited for tasks involving sequential data, such as natural language processing, speech recognition, machine translation, time series analysis, and sentiment analysis. They can effectively model dependencies and capture context in these domains.\n",
        "\n",
        "By leveraging recurrent connections and hidden state information, RNNs excel at processing and understanding sequential data. They are powerful tools for tasks that require temporal modeling and have made significant contributions to the field of deep learning."
